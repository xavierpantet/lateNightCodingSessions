# Late Night Coding Sessions
Welcome to my late night programming projects repo! It's nothing especially interesting nor useful, I'm just leaving this here. Enjoy!
1. Authenticator

   A simple web tool to store and give you access to your passwords with double authentication system and quick removal.
2. iTunes Observer

   A rather short program written in Swift that listens to iTunes events (on Mac) and sends every update to your server, in case you want to show it somewhere.
