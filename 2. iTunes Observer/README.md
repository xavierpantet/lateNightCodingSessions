# iTunes Observer
Keep track of what iTunes plays for you (Mac only)

This program is completely boring, just read the f*ucking code. Basically, you subscribe to iTunes events and whenever you get an update, an HTTP request is sent to your server and you are free to do whatever you want with it at this point.
